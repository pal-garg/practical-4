<div><p>Everything you have ever seen on the web is considered 'front-end'.Front-end is what we see when we open a web page or app.
    Code is downloaded from a server and is rendered to the screen by a browser. What happens when we interact with the code is also considered frontend. This is often referred to as the 'Presentation Layer' or 'Client' in software development terms.
    The front end is built i=out of three languages:HTML, CSS and Javascript.
    HTML allows us to put content on our page. It allows the content to have different text colors, bbackground colors, as well as dealing with the positioning
    of the content on the page. JavaScript makes our page dynamic.
